Teams score points by:

- Scoring CORAL (foam tubes) on their REEF (hexagonal structure).
    
- Harvesting ALGAE (rubber balls) and scoring them in the BARGE (center structure with nets) or the PROCESSOR (opening in the wall).
    
- Attaching their ROBOT to their CAGE (hanging structure under the BARGE) at the end of the match.
    
- Cooperating with the opposing alliance to score ALGAE in the PROCESSOR.
